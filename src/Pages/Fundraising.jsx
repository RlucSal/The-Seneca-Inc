        The Seneca Capital Campaign
        </h3>
        <p>
        The Seneca Capital Campaign is run separately from our general fund. In order to physically establish our lasting commitment to women at Harvard, we must purchase a building. This property would serve both as a home for our activities and as a space for other Harvard women's groups to use. The whole of this sum would be used to purchase property in the immediate vicinity of the Harvard campus. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Donations can also be used to provide financial aid to members in
          need. The Seneca has received 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, making
          all contributions tax-deductibleâ€”even retroactively for past
          donations.
